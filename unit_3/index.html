     <h1>Taste of Chicago</h1>
     <p> Welcome to the taste of the city!</p> 
     <p> Hi Everyone! Welcome to my food blog. My blog will feature my reviews (opinions) on my favorite restuarants, and brunch spots. I will take you through my journey and what I love about the city.  It will also include my love of food photography. Chicago has alot to offer in terms of unique food, and adventure. So I hope you like my page. Feel free to leave comments and follow me on Instagram at Jacquelineng91.</p>
